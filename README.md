# Real-Time Audio Transcription Chrome Extension

> Developed by: Wesley Wei

## About

This is a Chrome Extension designed to capture audio and provide real-time transcription. It has two different audio processing modes: tab and microphone. There are also two different transcript processing modes: real-time and chunks. After transcribing the audio, the user can then either copy the transcript to their clipboard or download TXT/JSON files.

The audio transcription is provided by Google's Speech-to-Text API, so an API key is required in order to make this Chrome Extension to work properly.

### Example Use Cases

-   Opening up a YouTube/Netflix/SoundCloud tab and recording transcriptions.
-   Opening up a random Google Chrome tab a, selecting microphone as an audio source, and record a video meeting conversation (where the microphone picks up your speech and the other speaker's speech from the speakers).
    > _Both cases they could copy or download (TXT/JSON) the transcript_
